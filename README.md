Ts3Query
========

A TeamSpeak status monitor.
---------------------------

Ts3Query is a webapp that lists users connected to a server for the VOIP
application [TeamSpeak 3](http://teamspeak.com/). Developed to scratch my own
itch, I built on web.py, which let me work in Python without imposing the
overhead of a larger framework. Though the user interface was clearly designed
by a programmer, the underlying library which interfaces with Teamspeak's query
interface is both robust and flexible.

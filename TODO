Ensure XSS not introducd due to jQuery usage.
Highlight clicked-on user.
Automatic ajax update of connected clients & channels.
Load server info initially without ajax to prevent waiting for scrolling display.
Store SID to prevent having to query for it on each connection -- reduce query count by 1.
Look into using long-lived connections (websockets? comet?) to enable near-real-time querying.
Allow user to send text message to server/channel/client.
Provide idle times for each client in command-line output.
Imbue Web interface with greater aesthetic appeal.
  Look into using alternative handwritten font, perhaps -- I chose the current one in haste.
Figure out why Lighttpd doesn't cache font (is the file too big?)
  This leads to scrolling issues on display -- font may not have loaded by time our 500 ms timeout has elapsed
